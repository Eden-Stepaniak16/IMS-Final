    <p>The theme of my product catalog project is about sweets. My product catalog is called Sugar Haven and this is a
      place where you can buy and enjoy eating some of your favorite sweets. I choose to do this theme because I myself
      enjoy eating desserts and in the future I would love to open up and own an ice cream shop. I did make changes from
      my wireframe to my final. I added light pink cards to go around each of my products. I did this to make the
      product catalog look more clean and organized. I also changed some of the images. I also added two pop up cards
      instead of just one. I did this to make it easier for my viewers to understand when they are adding a product to
      their cart and or when they are just looking. Some challenges that I dealt with was centering everything in my CSS
      and adding the pop up cards in my Java Script. This was the most difficult but if I was unsure on how to do
      something then I would take a look at my class notes or W3 Schools.
