    <p>My name is Eden Stepaniak and I am currently a junior at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. My major is
      Communication Design with a minor in Emerging
      Technology in Business and Design (ETBD). I want to be a Graphic Designer one day and design my own work. This is
      my project gallery with my three
      favorite projects that I have done through out my IMS 322 class. Today I will be showing you my FAQ, music player,
      and product catalog projects. Taking this class
      was a challenge but I enjoyed every part of it and learning new material to add to my portfolio.
